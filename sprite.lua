--- Sprite related variables and functions.
...

--- The alpha of the sprite, represented by a number in the range of 0 - 1. An alpha of 0 means the sprite is completely transparent; 1 means fully visible. By default 1.
alpha = 1

--- The blend mode of the sprite. By default "normal".
--- Valid blend modes are defined here:
--- <https://airsdk.dev/reference/actionscript/3.0/flash/display/BlendMode.html>
blendMode = "normal"

--- The number of children the sprite has. By default 0. Read-only.
--- @see addChild
--- @see removeChild
numChildren = 0

--- Whether or not the sprite was destroyed. Calling `destroy` sets this to true. Read-only.
destroyed = false

--- Starts a solid fill with the given ARGB values. Subsequent draw operations will rely on this fill until the fill is ended.
--- You must call endFill() to ensure all draw operations take effect.
--- @tparam int color The ARGB value of the fill. By default `0xFFFFFFFF`. The simplest way to provide this value is with the `0xAARRGGBB` hex format, where AA is the hex value from 0 - 255 for the alpha, RR for red, GG for green, and BB for blue.
--- @see endFill
--- @usage someSprite.beginFill(0xFF0000FF) -- Draw everything with a solid, fully opaque blue.
---- someSprite.drawEllipse(0, 0, 100, 200)

--- @param ratios An AS3 array of the color distribution ratios; valid values are 0-255. These values define the percentages of the width where the respective color is sampled at 100%. The value 0 represents the left position in the gradient box, and 255 represents the right position in the gradient box. Each value must be greater than the last.
--- @param vars An AS3 object containing any optional parameters for the gradient fill. Valid options are:
---- 
---- * !type: (***string***) The type of gradient fill. Can be either "linear" or "radial". By default "linear".

---- 
---- * !y: (***number***) The distance, in pixels, to translate the gradient box values down along the y-axis. This value is offset by half of the height parameter. By default 0.
---- 
---- * !rotation: (***number***) The amount to rotate the gradient box values, in degrees.

A value less than -1 or greater than 1 is clamped to -1 or 1
